		<h1>Chloe Richardson</h1>
		<p>Hi, I’m Chloe and I’m a senior here at SUNY Oswego, but I’m originally from Torrington, Connecticut. I’m getting my BA in graphic design while also doing some freelance graphic design work on the side. Aside from art, I also love animals and music, and am really looking forward to being able to go to concerts again (whenever that may be). I’ve never coded before, but I’m looking forward to learning!</p>
